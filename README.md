# DevOps Blockchain Project

Welcome to the **DevOps** repository! This project leverages blockchain technology, primarily using **Solidity** for smart contracts and a full-stack application built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline with integration to Ethereum development tools such as **Truffle** and **Ganache**, and deploys the front end using **Nginx**.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Below is the workflow YAML file located at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml
